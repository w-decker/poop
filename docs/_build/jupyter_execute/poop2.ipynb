    "Well, it's not anything physical. Think of it like a metaphorical toychest. The chest is the object. Inside they chest, there are toys. You can do different things with these toys. In Python, objects are called __classes__. They toys are called __methods__ and __attributes__. A method is like a toy that does stuff, like a car that moves, or legos that can be built. Attributes are more like figurines or barbie dolls: you mainly just look at them. Attibutes are primarily descriptive. \n",

This allows you to pull other components of the object into that function directly, like the attributes or other things that may have developed along the way in other methods. Like in this case: we require a parameter for `Car.drive()`, `distance`. The function then uses this to print a statement.
